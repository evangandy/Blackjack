    "# **Blackjack Card Counting**\n",

    "\n",

    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a lot of hands of blackjack using different card counting variables. The simulation tracks the money won or lost, bet amounts, and the running count of the cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The markdown / jupyter notebook style is inspired by Shouvik\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Card Counting: The simulation uses the ```data.csv``` file as a refrence for the general blackjack strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Games: The code runs thousands of hands to provide a a big enough sample to calculate an edge\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection: Then in this file I record money, bets, and card count history\n",
    "    - The final amount won is printed\n",
    "    - The total bet volume (how much money you would have had to risk)\n",
    "    - The edge (the ratio of money won to money risked)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization: Then I plot all of the data for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Money won or lost over the course of the games\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Bet amounts per game\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Accumulated money over the rounds, including a trend line\n",

    "\n",
    "The following code simulates all the games\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup:**\n",
    "   - It creates empty lists to keep track of how much money is won (`money`), how much money is bet (`bets`), and the history of card counting (`countings`).\n",
    "   - It sets a counter (`nb_hands`) to zero to count the total number of hands played.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Play Many Games:**\n",
    "   - It repeats the following steps for a set number of games:\n",
    "      - Starts a new game of blackjack.\n",
    "      - Keeps playing rounds of blackjack until the cards need to be reshuffled.\n",
    "      - During each round, it counts the cards to try to predict if the player or dealer is more likely to win and then bets accordinly\n",
    "      - After the game, it records how much money was won or lost, how much was bet in total, and the card counting history.\n",
    "      - You can uncomment a line to see the game by game play through however if you change the # of games past 10,000 I would leave it uncommented\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Results:**\n",
    "   - It adds up all the money won/lost across all games (`money_won`).\n",
    "   - It adds up all the bets made across all games (`bet_volume`).\n",
    "   - It calculates the overall percentage of money won compared to the total amount bet. This percentage shows the effectiveness of the card counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Show Results:**\n",
    "   - It prints the total money won/lost, the total amount bet, and the percentage of money won compared to the total amount bet.\n",
    "   - Usually the edge value should be between 1% to 4%, the greater the edge the more effective the strategy.\n"
